# Machine Learning Implementations

This repository contains the code the different implementations done for the course ES654 Machine Learning at IITGn taken by Prof. Nipun Batra. [Course Website](https://nipunbatra.github.io/ml2023/)

A breif description of each assignment and what each directory contains is given below. For a better understanding please go through the README.md files in each directory

### Assignment-0

This is Jupyter notebook, for the pre-requisite quiz needed for enrollment in this course. The questions can also be found on this [link](https://nipunbatra.github.io/ml2023/exams/prereq.html).

### Assignment-1

Our goal was to implement Decision Tree implementation from scratch without the use of any libraries like `sklearn`, for all the four cases, i.e.:-

- Real Input Real Output
- Discrete Input Discrete Output
- Real Input Discrete Output 
- Discrete Output and Real Output

Use cross-validation techniques and compare the efficiency of our implementation with SKLearn's implementation.

### Assignment-2

Contains the implementations of following algorithms from scratch:-

- Bias-Variance Trade-Off
- Decision Tree with Weights
- Adaboost
- Bagging

- [GitHub Report](https://github.com/divyanshu0x16/taylor_series_approximations)

### Assignment-4

Contains the implementations of following algorithms from scratch:-

- Linear Regression using SKLearn, Normal Equations and SVD
- Gradient Descent computation done analytically and using JAX
- Gradient Descent, SGD, SGD with Momentum with Unregularized, LASSO and Ridge Regularization.
- Polynomial Preprocessing
- Autoregressive Model for Time-Series data

### Assignment-5

We had to implement a Binary Classifier using VGG based models and compare their performances. Additionally we also had to create a MLP with similar number of parameters as VGG16 and do performance analysis.
